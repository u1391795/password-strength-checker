# **Password Strength Checker**  

## **Description**  
This program checks the strength of a password based on length, character variety, and common password lists. It provides feedback to help improve weak passwords.  

## **How to Run the Program**  

### **Prerequisites**  
- Python 3.x must be installed.  

### **Installation and Usage**  
1. Clone this repository or download `password_checker.py`.  
   ```sh  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/password-strength-checker.git  
   cd password-strength-checker  
   ```  
2. Run the script using Python:  
   ```sh  
   python password_checker.py  
   ```  
3. Enter a password when prompted. The program will evaluate its strength and provide suggestions.  

## **How It Works**  
- Password strength is checked based on:  
  - **Length** (minimum 8 characters, recommended 12+)  
  - **Character variety** (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters)  
  - **Common password list** (flags passwords that are too common)  

- Passwords are categorized as:  
  - **Strong** (meets all requirements)  
  - **Moderate** (needs improvements)  
  - **Weak** (easily guessable, insecure)  

## **Limitations & Warnings**  
**This tool is for educational purposes only.**  
- It does **not** check if a password has been leaked in data breaches.  
- It does **not** enforce security policies; it only provides recommendations.  
- No passwords are stored or logged by this program.  

For better security, use **a password manager** and **multi-factor authentication (MFA).**  

## **Ethical Considerations & Responsible Use**  
- This tool is designed to **educate users on password security** and should not be used in any **malicious or unauthorized manner**.  
- It **does not replace** enterprise-level security solutions and should not be relied on for securing sensitive data.  
- Even strong passwords can be compromised if reused across multiple sites or leaked in data breaches.
